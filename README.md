# Calculator v 1.0


This calculator has been created using HTML, SCSS, CSS and JavaScript and is the week-2 project of the _nology.io Software Engineering Bootcamp.

The design of this calculator has been created to resemble that of an iOS calculator.



--> OPERATIONS

- This calculator can perform all the standard operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and accepts both integers and decimals.
- It can also perform chained operations and return the final output (i.e. 4 * 5 / 2 - 7 + 2 = 5).
- The "%" button divides the number on display by 100.
- The "+/-" button turns a positive number into a negative one and viceversa.
- The "C" button clears the display and initializes the operations.

- Each number can contain only one decimal point.
